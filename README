## Overview

This project enables building a Docker container with a fully configured Android emulator. Itâ€™s designed to streamline the creation and running of Android emulators with defined device types and configurations.

## Requirements

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. See [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Docker Image Details

The Docker image is based on `mahmoudazaid/android:15`, which includes the necessary dependencies for Android development. Additional dependencies are installed within this Dockerfile to support the emulator's display and network configurations.

## Environment Variables

Define the following environment variables to customize the emulator setup:

| Variable           | Description                                   | Default Value   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `EMULATOR_NAME`    | The name of the Android emulator instance     | `emulator`      |
| `EMULATOR_DEVICE`  | Device model for the emulator                 | `pixel_6`       |
| `EMULATOR_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in seconds for the emulator to boot up | `300`           |
| `EMULATOR_PACKAGE` | Android emulator system image package         | Defined in base image |

## Build and Run

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/android-emulator .
